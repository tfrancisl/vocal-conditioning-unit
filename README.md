*** Vocal Conditioning Unit ***
Software for Tim Lester and Grady White's senior design project at UMaine.

The goal of the vocal conditioning unit is to provide a simple interface to a singer or other monophonic musician with which they can experience pitch adjustment as well as microphone amplification and compression.
